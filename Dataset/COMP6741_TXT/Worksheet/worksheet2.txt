COMP474/6741 Intelligent Systems (Winter 2024)Worksheet #2: Vocabularies & OntologiesTask 1. Quick refresher: Using the N-Triples (N3) serialization format, write an RDF triple describingÏConcordia’s location (city), as recorded in the wikidata.org knowledge graph:Task 2. Define the fact that Student is a class (as opposed to an instance, like Jane). UseTurtle format with the following prefix definitions and define Student as part of the ex namespace(ex:Student):@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .Add the triple to explicitly define ex:Student as a class within the ex namespace:and draw the resulting RDF graph:Task 3. Now add another triple stating that Jane (ex:jane) is of type ex:Student:and add it to the graph above.Task 4. It is good practice to give every IRI a human-readable label (where appropriate). Add twordfs:label triples (in English and French) for “Student”:1.2.(Similarly, you would define an rdfs:comment to explain what it means to be a student.)Task 5. For now at least, every Student is a Person (sorry, robots!). Define this fact as a triple (usethe class foaf:Person) and add it to your graph above:COMP474/6741 Worksheet: Vocabularies & Ontologies Winter 2024Task 6. Ok, let’s look at these three triples (written in pseudocode for brevity):<FG-C080> <teaches> <COMP474/6741> .<professor> <is a> <slide> .<student> <handed in by> <assignment> .Are these syntactically legal triples? (Spoiler alert: yes, we could write each of them using perfectly fineRDF URIs.) So what exactly is wrong here? (Discuss with your worksheet team partner!)Task 7. We now define a property, studiesAt, so that we can indicate at which university a student isstudying. Write the triple defining studiesAt as a property (again using the ex: namespace):(Note: properties should also have labels & comments, but we omit this here.)Task 8. We now have to add domain and range restrictions for our property to avoid problems like theones in Task 6 above. For the domain of our studiesAt property, we only permit ex:Student resourcesand for the range, we only admit ex:University resources. Write the two triples:1.2.Task 9. A widely used vocabulary for describing people and their (social) networks is Friend-of-a-FriendÏ(FOAF), which you’ve seen before:PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>1. Assume Joe has a photo of him published under http://facebook.me/joe.png (not a real URL).How can you add this information to the knowledge graph using FOAF (hint: look up the vocabu-lary using the prefix URL above):2. Again using FOAF, model that Jane is 22 years old (use datatype integer for the age):
