b'COMP 6721Applied Artificial IntelligenceDepartment of Computer Science and Software EngineeringFall 2023Course Instructor: Dr. Ren\xc3\xa9 Witte, Associate ProfessorEmail: rene.witte@concordia.caOffice Hours:Every Wednesday, 15:00-16:00, in ER 933 (starting Week 2).Online meetings (via Zoom) can also be scheduled on-demand via Moodle.You can also reach me on Moodle chat (works best for short, quick questions).Labs: Please see your class schedule for detailsLab Demonstrators:Mr. Amin KarimiMs. Naghmeh ShafieeCourse Calendar Description:The course covers heuristic and adversarial searches for concrete applications. It then discusses automated reasoning, advanced knowledge representation and dealing with uncertainly for Artificial Intelligence applications. Finally, it introduces autoencoders, recurrent neural networks and sequence to sequence models. A project is required.Note: Students who have completed COMP 472 may not take this course for credit.Specific Knowledge and Skills Needed for this Course: To succeed in this course, you will need specific skills and knowledge in the following areas:Programming Skills:\xe2\x80\xa2 Python: Proficiency in general programming using Python is essential for lab sessions and the course project. A brief introduction to Python will be provided during the first lab session, but pre-existing familiarity is strongly recommended.Mathematical Foundations:\xe2\x80\xa2 Probability Theory: A strong understanding of probability is needed, particularly for topics involving machine learning and decision-making algorithms.\xe2\x80\xa2 Linear Algebra: Concepts from linear algebra will be utilized frequently, especially in machine learning and neural network modules.If you find yourself lacking in any of these areas, you are strongly encouraged to review these topics before the DNE (Did Not Enter) deadline.Course materialsThere is no single textbook that will be used for this course. For each lecture topic, required andrecommended readings will be posted as part of the lecture information on Moodle. Generally,these  readings  will  be  available  online  or  as  an  electronic  resource  through  the  ConcordiaLibrary.Grading SchemeYour grade will be based on exams and a team project (split into  multiple submissions). Thegrading distribution of these deliverables is as follows:35% Course Project (team work, split into 2-3 submissions)15% Midterm Exam50% Final Exam  Letter  grades  for  this  course  will  be  assigned  based  on  a  curve,  which  means  they  will  bedetermined in relation to  the overall  class  performance.  There is  no predetermined scale  forconverting percentages to letter grades, but the curve ensures that grading is fair and accounts forthe performance of all students. To pass the course, you must achieve at least 50% of the totalpossible marks.If your final exam grade (expressed as a percentage) is higher than your midterm exam grade, themidterm exam will be excluded from the calculation of your overall course grade. In this case, thefinal exam will make up 65% of your overall grade. However, this only applies if you havecompleted the midterm exam.Should you fail to write the midterm exam and you have valid justification (e.g., doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note)then the weight of the missed midterm will be added to the final exam.Note: It is your responsibility to adhere to the university\xe2\x80\x99s code of conduct as detailed in the calendar. All students must read and sign the Expectations of Originality form and submit the signed copy with their project deliverables.Tentative Course Schedule(Week 1)    Introduction to AI: Overview & History(Week 2)    State-Space Search: Uninformed & Heuristic Search(Week 3)    Adversarial Search: Mini-Max & Alpha-Beta Pruning(Week 4)    Introduction to Machine Learning (ML), Na\xc3\xafve Bayes Classifier(Week 5)    ML: Decision Trees, Evaluation & Unsupervised Learning                   Mid-term break: October 8-14(Week 6)    Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)(Week 7)    Introduction to Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)(Week 8)    Midterm exam (tentative!) \xe2\x80\x93 Knowledge Graphs & Intelligent Agents (I)(Week 9)    Knowledge Graphs & Intelligent Agents (II)(Week 10)  Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)(Week 11)  NLP II: Vector Space Model, Deep Learning(Week 12)  NLP III: Transformers                   Examination period: December 6-19 (date of final exam tbd)A more detailed week-by-week breakdown, as well as additional information for each topic, willbe available on the Moodle web site.https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/ginacody/docs/Expectations-of-Originality-Feb14-2012.pdfLab DetailsBeginning in Week 2, weekly lab sessions are an obligatory part of this course and will take placein-person and on campus. Make sure to attend the specific lab section for which you are registered.Before each lab, it is essential that you review the previous week\'s lecture material, complete any assigned readings, and review the corresponding lecture worksheet. While the lectures focus on theoretical concepts and algorithms, the labs introduce new programming content not covered in the lectures. These sessions offer hands-on experience with practical applications through variousAI libraries and toolkits, such as Python\'s scikit-learn and PyTorch.In summary, the lectures and labs are designed to work in tandem, offering a comprehensive understanding of AI by merging theoretical foundations with practical coding skills.Active LearningStarting with the second lecture on Search, we will use Active Learning concepts in this course. Active Learning involves engaging with the material, classmates, and instructor in a more interactive way than simply listening to a lecture. In particular, worksheets will be distributed containing mini-exercises that you will solve in teams of two during practise sessions that last a few minutes each. The reasons for using active learning include:\xe2\x80\xa2 Enhanced Retention: Research shows you remember more when you actively engage with material.\xe2\x80\xa2 Immediate Feedback: Worksheets and pair discussions allow you to instantly clarify doubts and reinforce understanding.\xe2\x80\xa2 Peer Learning: Working with classmates exposes you to different perspectives and problem-solving approaches.If you have never taken a class using active learning, you might have concerns like the following:\xe2\x80\xa2 Feeling Shy?: No worries! Active learning tasks are designed to be non-judgmental spaces for exploration. You won\'t be put "on the spot" in front of the class.\xe2\x80\xa2 Don\'t Want to Interact?: While collaboration is encouraged, the primary focus is on deepening your own understanding. Active learning can be a personal process too.Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs): By the end of this semester, students are expected to master the following skills and areas of knowledge:Critical Analysis: Ability to critically analyze different AI algorithms, evaluating their appropriateness for various applications.Data Interpretation: Develop skills in preprocessing and interpreting large datasets, making them suitable for AI and machine learning models.Algorithm Implementation: Gain hands-on experience in implementing, testing, and debugging algorithms in a popular programming environment like Python.Model Evaluation: Acquire the knowledge and skills to evaluate the performance of different AIand machine learning models using various metrics.AI System Design: Ability to design simple AI systems that incorporate elements of machine learning, natural language processing, and/or deep learning algorithms.Collaboration Skills: Gain experience in collaborative problem-solving and project development, through the team project and lab sessions.Comparative Analysis: Learn to compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of various AI and machine learning approaches in different settings.Application to Real-World Problems: Gain the ability to apply theoretical concepts in AI to real-world scenarios, appreciating the complexities and constraints of actual implementations.Health and Safety GuidelinesGeneral health and safety instructions and available health and safety trainings can be found at:Safety Programs - Concordia University   (https://www.concordia.ca/campus-life/safety/general-  safety.html)On Campus ResourcesPlease visit Student services at Concordia University (https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/students/services.html)     for the services available to Gina Cody School students.https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/students/services.htmlhttps://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/students/services.htmlhttps://www.concordia.ca/campus-life/safety/general-safety.html'
