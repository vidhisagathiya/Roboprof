Years later, framesturned out to be the basis of object-oriented programming.• year 1974• source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(artificial_intelligence)11) The expert system MYCIN is developed to recognise bacterial infections and recommendantibiotics. Its recommendations are often better than those of human experts. It isbased on a knowledge base of ≈ 600 hand-written rules (written in Lisp) and developedin collaboration with medical doctors.• year 1975• source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycin12) The METEO rule-based machine translation system, developed at the University of Mon-treal, is deployed at Environment Canada to translate weather forecasts from English toFrench.1Guess why it was called this way? ;-)2https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winterhttp://hci.stanford.edu/~winograd/shrdlu/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakey_the_robothttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Colmerauerhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(artificial_intelligence)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycin• year 1975• source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METEO_System13) Expert systems, such as MYCIN, and other types of systems made of hand-written rulesare considered too expensive to maintain and to adapt to new domains. The industrydrops research in such systems. It is the 2nd AI Winter.• late 1980’s – early 1990’s• source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter14) Corinna Cortes and Vladimir Vapnik develop an approach to machine learning called softmargin Support Vector Machines (SVM), which quickly becomes one of the most popularmachine learning algorithm.• 1993• source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine15) After finishing his PhD on handwriting recognition, Yann Lecun makes public the MNISTdataset. The dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits and becomes thebenchmark to evaluate machine learning.• year 1998• source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine_learning_research16) Google launches its Google Translate service based on Statistical Machine Translation.Translation rules are found automatically based on a statistical analysis of parallel textsin different languages.• year 2006• source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate17) Netflix initiates a competition in machine learning to beat its own film recommendationsystem. It provides a data set of about 100 millions movie ratings to learn recommenda-tions automatically.• year 2006• source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize18) The AlexNet system, developed at the University of Toronto by Alex Krizhevsky, a PhDstudent of Geoffrey Hinton, wins the ImageNet Challenge and shows that deep learningtechniques can achieve significantly better results than classical machine learning tech-niques in image processing. This is considered to be a defining moment in the history ofAI.3https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METEO_Systemhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winterhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machinehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine_learning_researchhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine_learning_researchhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translatehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize• year 2012• source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet19) While having a beer at Les 3 Brasseurs at the corner of McGill College and Ste-Catherine,Ian Goodfellow, a PhD student of Yoshua Bengio, comes up with an idea for a neural net-work that could generate realistic images.
