COMP 6721 Applied Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2023)Worksheet #1: Solving Problems by SearchingThis is an active learning exercise; we’ll work on it during the lecture in teams of two!Breadth-First Search. Let’s apply the BFS algorithm discussed in the lecture on an example:Assume U is the goal state. Note that open is a queue:1. open = [Anull], closed = [ ]2. open = [BA CA DA], closed = [A]3. open = [CA DA EB FB ], closed = [B A]4. open = [ ], closed = [ ]5. open = [ ], closed = [ ]6. open = [ ], closed = [ ]7. open = [ ], closed = [ ]Depth-First Search. Now we do the same for the DFS algorithm:Again, assume U is the goal state. Note that open is a stack:1. open = [Anull], closed = [ ]2. open = [BA CA DA], closed = [A]3. open = [EB FB CA DA], closed = [B A]4. open = [KE LE FB CA DA], closed = [E B A]5. open = [SK LE FB CA DA], closed = [K E B A]6. open = [ ], closed = [ ]7. open = [ ], closed = [ ]8. open = [ ], closed = [ ]9. open = [ ], closed = [ ]10. open = [ ], closed = [ ]COMP6721 Worksheet: Solving Problems by Searching Fall 2023Best-First Search. Next, we try a best-first (greedy) search. We have a heuristic h(n) that estimates the cost foreach path. The goal is P. At each step, expand the node with the lowest cost (as predicted by the heuristic), i.e., sortthe open list by h(n) (smallest first):1. open = [A5null], closed = [ ]2. open = [B4A C 4A D6A] (random choice), closed = [A]3. open = [C 4A E 5B F 5B D6A], closed = [B A]4. open = [ ], closed = [ ]5. open = [ ], closed = [ ]6. ???Finally, extract the path to the solution from the search result:Algorithm A. Compute the next step of the Algorithm A on the 8-puzzle:1. Pick the state with the lowest total cost f (n)2. and compute the next possible search states, including the new values of f (n), g(n) and h(n).
