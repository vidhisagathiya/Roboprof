COMP 6721 Applied Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2023)Worksheet #2: Adversarial SearchGame of Nim. Play a game of Nim against your team mate, starting with 7 tokens: circle the tokens that you splitinto the two new piles at each move (piles must be non-empty and differently-sized). Player “MIN” starts:(MIN) • • • • • • • (MAX)MiniMax. Let’s apply the MiniMax algorithm discussed in the lecture on an example (fixed ply depth of 3):1. Apply Step 4: Add the back-up heuristic values of all non-leaf (internal) nodes, up to the root2. Apply Step 5: Highlight the best next move for MAX (from root, one move only)MiniMax Heuristic for Tic-Tac-Toe. Using the heuristic shown below, compute the values of e(n) for the threegame states (MAX plays X):Two-ply MiniMax. Compute the missing values using MiniMax in the game tree shown below (same heuristic asabove, start node is MAX). What will be MAX’s next move?COMP6721 Worksheet: Adversarial Search Fall 2023Alpha-Beta Pruning. Apply the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm:on the following search tree:We will compare and discuss the results after each of the three steps:Step 1: Perform the Alpha-Beta procedure (left-to-right) until you reached the node marked with “Step 1”.• Call alphabeta( root, 4, −∞, +∞, TRUE)• Circle each node that you explored and show which subtrees are cut off by the algorithm (if any).Step 2: Now continue with the algorithm until you reached the node marked “Step 2”, marking explored nodes andcut subtrees as before.Step 3: Complete the algorithm until you calculated the value for the root node in the same fashion.How many nodes did the algorithm explore (out of 27 possible): ?
