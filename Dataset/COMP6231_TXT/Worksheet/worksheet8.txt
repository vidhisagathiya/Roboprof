COMP 6721 Applied Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2023)Worksheet #8: Knowledge Graphs & Intelligent Agents, Part IIN-Triples. Quick refresher: Using the N-Triples serialization format, write an RDF triple describing Concordia’sÏwebsite as recorded in wikidata.org:Your first Vocabulary. Define the fact that Student is a class (as opposed to an instance, like Jane). Use thefollowing prefix definitions and define Student as part of the ex namespace (ex:Student):@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .Add the triple:Creating Instances. Now add another triple stating that Jane (ex:jane#me) is of type ex:Student:Subclasses. For now at least, every Student is a Person (sorry, robots!). Define this fact as a triple (use foaf:Personfor the namespace):Note: use the same ex: namespace for the new subclass as before for Student.Properties. We now define a property, studiesAt, so that we can indicate at which university a student is studying.Write the triple defining studiesAt as a property (use the ex: namespace as before):(Note: properties should also have labels & comments, but we omit this here for brevity.)COMP6721 Worksheet: Knowledge Graphs II Fall 2023Are we there yet? Ok, let’s look at these three triples (written in pseudocode for brevity):<FG-C070> <teaches> <COMP6721> .<professor> <is a> <slide> .<student> <handed in by> <assignment> .Are these syntactically legal triples? (Spoiler alert: yes, we could write each of them using perfectly fine RDF URIs.)So what exactly is wrong here? (Discuss with your worksheet team partner!)Domain & Range. We now have to add domain and range restrictions for our property to avoid problems like theones shown above. For the domain of our studiesAt property, we only permit ex:Student resources and for therange, we only admit ex:University resources. Write the two triples:1.2.FOAF. A widely used vocabulary for describing people and their (social) networks is Friend-of-a-Friend (FOAF),Ïwhich you’ve seen before:PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>1. Assume Joe has a photo of him published under http://facebook.me/joe.png (not a real URL). How canyou add this information to the knowledge graph using FOAF (hint: look up the vocabulary using the prefixURL above):2. Again using FOAF, model that Jane is 22 years old:Linked Data. How is Concordia University in the DBpedia knowledge graph linked to Wikidata? Find the propertyÏand object for:1<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concordia University>SPARQL. Your first SPARQL query: What can you find in Wikidata with (use the public SPARQL query interfaceÏat https://query.wikidata.org/):SELECT ?book ?bookLabelWHERE{?book wdt:P50 wd:Q35610 .?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel}Your own AI Agent. Consider the output of a commercial AI, for example the Google Assistant, when you askÏa question like “What is Concordia University?”: You’ll typically see a definition as part of the answer that oftencomes from Wikipedia (“Concordia University, commonly referred to as Concordia, is a public comprehensive researchuniversity located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada...”). Write a SPARQL query that retrieves this information fromDBpedia, using its public query interface at https://dbpedia.org/sparql/. Hint: use the rdfs:comment field (dbr: isa pre-defined prefix for http://dbpedia.org/resource/:SELECT ?descriptionWHERE {dbr:Concordia_University . . . . . . . . . . . .}1Note: similar to Wikidata’s /resource to /wiki redirect, DBpedia will display a human-readable HTML page for a /resource underthe /page path, whereas programs would be redirected to the /data path for the raw RDF data.http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concordia_Universityhttps://query.wikidata.org/https://dbpedia.org/sparql/
