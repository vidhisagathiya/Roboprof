COMP 6721 Course Project  COMP 6721Course Project:”A.I.ducation Analytics”A.I.ducation Analyticshttps://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/recognizing-human-facial-expressions-machine-learning  Classes to detectWorking on still images of students in a classroom setting (virtual or physical)Mandatory classes (for all groups):● Neutral expression● Engaged/Focused● Bored/TiredAdditional class (your group selects one):● Angry/Irritated● Confused● DistractedCNN for Emotion Detectionhttps://visagetechnologies.com/emotion-recognition/  Part 0: Group formation(starting today)● You suggest teams on Moodle● 3 members● Deadline: Friday 6th● We announce final teams early next week Part 1: Data Collection & Cleaning● Collect datasets● Data cleaning (e.g., size correction)● Data labeling● Dataset VisualizationProject PhasesPart 2: Basic CNN Model & Evaluation● Using PyTorch● Build model to detect above classes● Basic evaluation (Accuracy, P, R, F1, Confusion Matrix)● Project DemoPart 3: Bias Analysis, Model refinement, Deep Evaluation● Check Model from Part 2 for bias (e.g., age, race, gender)● Improve model, correct bias● Evaluation with k-fold cross-validation● Project Demo  Team specializationTraining SpecialistResponsible for CNN training:● Define CNN architecture● Set hyperparameters● Monitor training progress● Fix convergence issuesEvaluation SpecialistResponsible for CNN analysis:● Compute evaluation metrics● Diagnose weaknesses● Visualize results● Bias analysis● Cross-validationData SpecialistResponsible for data lifecycle:● Data sourcing● Data quality● Data pre-processing● Data augmentation● Exploratory Data AnalysisYour Project GroupNote: specialist does not do all the work, but oversees, manages, and distributes sub-tasks to others  Submissions & Demos● Electronic submissions on Moodle● Late submission penalties● Must submit Python programs, not notebooks● Project must be demoed for Parts 2&3● All team members must be present for demosContribution & Grading● All team members are expected to contribute equally● By default, all members get the same marks● Escalate issues first in team, then to TA, who can futher escalate to instructor● In case of dispute, a formal process is started (will need to prove contribution with Github logs or similar)Academic Integrity● Review academic code of conduct● Do not copy any work or data● Cite sources you use● You must submit a signed Expectation of Originality form (no marks without form)● Keep your repositories privateMost important...● Don’t focus (only) on end performance:● We will look at how well you managed the whole AI/ML process● Have fun working on the project!
