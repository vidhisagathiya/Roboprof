COMP 6721 Applied Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2023)Project Assignment, Part IDue date (Moodle Submission): Friday, October 27thCounts for 20% of the course projectProject Introduction: “A.I.ducation Analytics”. Welcome to A.I.ducation Analytics, where thefuture of AI-driven academic feedback takes shape. Dive into a world where, as AI lectures unfoldcomplex algorithms, instructors are no longer in the dark! Your innovative system scrutinizes students’facial responses in real-time, distinguishing the curious from the overwhelmed. A sleek dashboardoffers the instructor immediate insights—30% engaged, 20% neutral, 10% nearing cognitive overload.Smart AI suggestions nudge adjustments in real-time, ensuring lectures evolve in response to learners’needs. As graduate students on this frontier project, you’re not just coding—you’re sculpting the nextphase of dynamic, AI-enhanced education.Image from https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/recognizing-human-facial-expressions-machine-learningThe objective of this project is to develop a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)using PyTorch that can analyze images of students in a classroom or online meeting setting andcategorize them into distinct states or activities. Your system has to be able to analyse images inorder to recognize four classes. The first three classes are common, mandatory ones that you mustdetect:Neutral: A student presenting neither active engagement nor disengagement, with relaxed facial fea-tures.Engaged/Focused: A student evidencing signs of active concentration, with sharp and attentive eyes.Bored/Tired: A student displaying signs of weariness or a lack of interest. This can be evidenced bydroopy eyes or vacant stares.https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/recognizing-human-facial-expressions-machine-learningCOMP6721 Fall 2023 Project Assignment #1And for the fourth class, your team has to pick one of these three additional classes:Angry/Irritated: Signs of agitation or displeasure, which might manifest as tightened facial muscles,a tight-lipped frown, or narrowed eyes.Confused: Signs of difficulty or misunderstanding, which might be evident as a raised eyebrow, aslight frown, or a puzzled expression.Distracted: The gaze or attention is directed away from the main subject or activity, indicating adiversion of focus.Course Project Overview. The whole project is split across three parts. Note that these are notstand-alone assignments, but rather build on top of each other to deliver the final, complete project(percentages show the marks attributed to each part for the course project grading item):Part 1: Data Collection, Cleaning, Labeling & Preliminary Analysis (20%). Here, you will developsuitable datasets that you will later need for training your system. This includes examining ex-isting datasets, mapping them to your classes, performing some pre-processing and basic analysis(see details below).Part 2: CNN Model Development and Basic Evaluation (35%). After you’ve learned about CNNsand PyTorch, you will build basic CNN models suitable to detect the above classes. This includesdeciding on the number of layers, type of layers (convolutional, pooling, fully connected), andactivation functions. You will have to apply basic evaluation metrics: Accuracy, confusionmatrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.Part 3: Bias Analysis, Model Refinement & Deep Evaluation (45%). Addressing bias and refin-ing models is advanced and crucial for AI’s ethical applications. You will use visualization toolsand metrics to identify bias in your model towards particular classes. Here, you will have toconsider demographic fairness to check for racial, age, or gender biases. You will then apply biasmitigation techniques to reduce bias. This can involve oversampling underrepresented classes,employing fairness constraints, or using techniques like adversarial debiasing. Additionally, youhave to apply deeper evaluation techniques, in particular k-fold cross-validation.Your project team. In successful real-world AI projects, collaboration and role specialization gohand-in-hand. While each team member should contribute holistically to the project, designatingareas of primary responsibility allows for focused expertise development and ensures every criticalaspect of the project is attentively managed. There are three roles:(I) Data Specialist: This individual will champion the dataset’s lifecycle. Key responsibilities encom-pass sourcing, pre-processing, loading, and exploratory data analysis. As the gatekeeper of dataquality and integrity, they will ensure the data is conducive for model training and evaluation.While the Data Specialist will author the dataset-related sections of the report, collaborativebrainstorming with the team will enhance data understanding and troubleshooting.(II) Training Specialist: Entrusted with the heartbeat of the project, this role dives deep into crafting,tuning, and training the Convolutional Neural Network. They’ll set hyperparameters, monitortraining progress, troubleshoot convergence issues, and collaborate closely with the Data Spe-cialist to understand data nuances that affect training. They will pen the model architectureand training portions of the report, but iterative feedback from the team is crucial for refiningthe model.(III) Evaluation Specialist: Once the model is trained, this expert will step in to gauge its prowess.They’ll run the model through a gamut of tests, meticulously dissect its predictions, and diagnoseCOMP6721 Fall 2023 Project Assignment #1areas of strength and weakness. Bias detection, cross-validation, and other advanced evaluationtechniques will be their arsenal. Their insights will shape the evaluation section of the report,and their findings will be pivotal in informing the Training Specialist’s model refinements.Remember, while each specialist has a primary domain, the essence of the project lies in the synergyamong team members. These designations are not silos but rather focal points. It is through combinedinsights, shared learnings, and collaborative efforts that the project will truly shine. In particular,this specialization does not mean the designated person does all the work for the specified sub-task,but rather oversees, manages, and distributes sub-tasks to other team members as appropriate.Project Part I. In this part, you will have to collect suitable training data and perform EDA (ex-ploratory data analysis) as follows:Training Data: Create datasets for training and testing your AI. You have to provide provenanceinformation, i.e., where you obtained each image in your dataset. You should re-use existingdatasets, but again please make sure you properly reference the source of the image datasets(name, author, source, license of the dataset). It is expected that you have a minimum of 1500training images and (additionally) 500 testing images (across all classes), so a minimum of 2000in total for four classes. Note: This is before applying any data augmentation strategies. Makesure that both your training and testing data sets are balanced, i.e., have roughly the samenumber of images per class.You must use real training data, i.e., using synthetic, generated data is not permitted.Data Cleaning: Images can have varied sizes, resolutions, or lighting conditions. Standardize thedataset by resizing images to a consistent dimension, and potentially applying some light pro-cessing to increase robustness (e.g., slight rotations, brightness adjustments, minor cropping).Labeling: If datasets are not pre-labeled or if there’s ambiguity, manual labeling might be required.For example, you might have to map single or multiple classes from different datasets to asuitable class for training your system. Platforms like Labelbox1 can be helpful.Dataset Visualization using scikit-learn and Matplotlib: Visualize your dataset to ensure you havean even distribution of classes and understand the nature of your data. This is crucial beforediving into model training, as having an imbalanced dataset, for instance, can affect model per-formance. Using Matplotlib, show your class distribution and plot a few sample images togetherwith their pixel intensity distribution (see the report section below for details). Gaining theseinsights early on will allow you to make informed decisions about any additional preprocessingor cleaning that your dataset might require.Report. You have to write a report detailing your findings, methodology, and analysis from ProjectPart I. Adherence to the specified structure and length constraints is crucial for ensuring a clearpresentation of your work.Title page: Presenting your group details such as the team name, team members, student ID numbers,each team member’s specialization, and a link to your project repository (e.g., on Github).Length: 1 pageDataset: For the dataset you created, provide the following details:• Overview of the existing datasets that you used: Including total number of images, numberper class, and any special characteristics of the dataset (e.g., mostly frontal face shots,diverse backgrounds, etc.)1https://labelbox.com/https://labelbox.com/COMP6721 Fall 2023 Project Assignment #1• Justification for dataset choices: Explain why these datasets were chosen, their relevanceto the project, and any challenges they might present.• Provenance Information: A detailed table listing where each image (or image batch) wassourced from. This can include links or references to the dataset, the licensing type, andany other relevant information.Length: ca. 2–3 pagesData Cleaning: Explain how you cleaned your data:• Detail the techniques and methods applied for standardizing the dataset, such as resizingand any light augmentation techniques.• Discuss the challenges encountered during the data cleaning process and how they wereaddressed.• Use example images to illustrate the before-and-after cleaning effect to substantiate yourclaims; For instance, how slight rotations or brightness adjustments impacted an image.Length: 1–2 pagesLabeling: In this section, detail how you arrived at the labels for your dataset:• Describe the methods and platforms/tools used for labeling. Discuss any ambiguities en-countered and how decisions were made to resolve them.• If multiple datasets were merged or if classes were mapped, provide details on how this wasaccomplished and any challenges faced.Length: 1–2 pagesDataset Visualization: Using Matplotlib, carry out the following tasks:• Class Distribution: Plot a bar graph showing the number of images in each class. Thishelps in understanding if any class is overrepresented or underrepresented.• Sample Images: Present a collection of 25 images in a 5 × 5 grid, with the entire gridsized to fit within the confines of a standard letter-sized page. Ensure that the images arerandomly chosen from each class upon every code execution. This visual representationaids in understanding the dataset’s content and helps identify any noticeable anomalies orpotential mislabelings.• Pixel Intensity Distribution: For the same random images, plot a histogram showingthe distribution of pixel intensities. This can provide insights into variations in lightingconditions among images. Note: for color (RGB) images, overlay the intensity distributionsof the Red, Green, and Blue channels on a single histogram.Length: 2–3 pagesReference Section: Contains citations, in IEEE style, to all pertinent resources consulted duringthe project. This includes books, websites, online tutorials, forums, and so forth. Remember,even if a resource only served as inspiration, it must be cited. Proper citation is essential formaintaining academic integrity (see below).2 Ensure that references to any image datasets arealso included here.Length: As required2If you are unsure about proper citation guidelines, see the resources provided by the Library at https://library.concordia.ca/help/citing/index.phphttps://library.concordia.ca/help/citing/index.phphttps://library.concordia.ca/help/citing/index.phpCOMP6721 Fall 2023 Project Assignment #1Deliverables. For the completion of Project Part I, ensure you bundle all the necessary items specifiedbelow into a single .zip or .tgz archive for submission:Python Code. All Python scripts developed for this project:• This encompasses scripts for data cleaning, data visualization, and dataset processing.• Note: Only pure Python code (.py files) will be accepted. Jupyter notebooks or otherformats will not be considered.• Your code should be well-commented and modular to facilitate easy understanding andevaluation.Dataset. A file or document detailing the provenance of each dataset/image:• For publicly available datasets, incorporate only a reference with the necessary details suchas dataset name, source, and licensing type (i.e., do not try to submit your whole datasetcontent here).• For custom or modified images, ensure you include them alongside any manually craftedmetadata.• Supply 10 representative images from each class within your archive and incorporate adirect link to the full dataset in your repository (e.g., on Github).README. A comprehensive readme.txt or readme.md file:• It must enumerate the contents and describe the purpose of each file in your submission.• Clearly outline the steps to execute your code for (a) data cleaning and (b) data visual-ization. If your instructions are incomplete and your code cannot be run you might notreceive marks for your work.Report. Your finalized project report:• Must be structured adhering to the guidelines provided earlier• Submit your report as a PDF file.Originality Form. Include a single Expectation of Originality form:• Available at https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/students/academic-services/expectation-of-originality.html• This form, attesting to the originality of your work, must be electronically signed by allteam members.• If the form is missing, your project will not be marked!Submission Procedure: You must submit your code electronically on Moodle by the due date (latesubmission will incur a penalty, see Moodle for details).Project Contribution and Grading Policy. In the spirit of collaboration and team unity, by default,all team members will receive the same grade for the project. This default policy is based on theexpectation that all team members actively contribute, collaborate, and collectively drive the projectto completion.However, we recognize that team dynamics can vary, and there might be instances where contributionsare disproportionate. In the event of a dispute regarding contributions:https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/students/academic-services/expectation-of-originality.htmlhttps://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/students/academic-services/expectation-of-originality.htmlCOMP6721 Fall 2023 Project Assignment #11. The team must first attempt to resolve the dispute internally. Open dialogue and clear commu-nication are encouraged to ensure all members are aligned on expectations and deliverables.2. If the internal resolution is unsuccessful and team members believe that the contributions havebeen significantly uneven, the team should approach their designated TA (acting as their ”projectmanager”) with their concerns. The TA will provide guidance and possibly mediate to helpresolve the issue.3. If after the TA’s intervention the dispute remains unresolved, the team may ask the TA toescalate the matter to the course instructor.4. For a dispute to be considered at this stage, the team must provide clear evidence that delin-eates individual contributions. This evidence should ideally be in the form of version controlrecords, such as Github change logs, commit messages, pull requests, and code reviews. Merelyhaving more commits doesn’t necessarily indicate greater contribution; the quality, relevance,and impact of the changes will be evaluated.5. Along with the evidence, a written statement detailing the nature of the dispute, reasons forthe perceived uneven contribution, prior attempts to resolve the matter internally, and theinvolvement of the TA should be submitted.6. The course instructor will review the submitted evidence and statements. After consideration,they may adjust individual grades to reflect the contributions more accurately. This decision isfinal.7. Any claims towards the contribution made after the final (late) submission deadline for eachpart will not be considered.Teams are strongly encouraged to maintain regular communication with their TA throughout theproject to preemptively address any potential conflicts and ensure smooth progression. The goal ofthis policy is not to encourage disputes but to provide a fair mechanism for resolution in the rareevent it’s needed.Academic Integrity Guidelines for the A.I.ducation Analytics Project. Upholding the principlesof academic integrity is paramount to the learning process. To ensure fairness, clarity, and ethicalbehavior throughout this project, the following guidelines have been set:1. Originality of Work: All submissions must be the original work of the team members.Copying or adapting work from other teams is strictly prohibited. Using external sourceswithout proper citation is also strictly prohibited (this includes ChatGTP and similar tools,see below). Such actions will be considered academic dishonesty and may lead to a failinggrade for the project or other disciplinary actions as deemed appropriate by the university’sacademic integrity policies. Please make sure you review the academic code of conduct athttps://www.concordia.ca/conduct/academic-integrity.html. Not knowing the code is not avalid defence for violating it!2. Citing External Sources: Should you use external sources, such as datasets, code snippets, orany other resources, you must provide clear citations. Ensure that you give appropriate credit byadding the source into your report’s reference section as defined above (using the IEEE format).Remember, acknowledging sources not only maintains academic integrity but also highlightsyour diligence in research.https://www.concordia.ca/conduct/academic-integrity.htmlCOMP6721 Fall 2023 Project Assignment #13. Usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT: Recognizing the relevance ofLLMs in modern AI, the use of tools like ChatGPT is permitted with specific restrictions:a. LLMs should complement your work, not serve as the main source of your solutions orcontent.b. When using LLMs, both the prompt you provided and the response from the model mustbe clearly displayed in your report. This ensures transparency and allows for a cleardifferentiation between student work and LLM-generated content.c. While LLMs can offer insights or clarify concepts, relying heavily on them diminishes thelearning experience. Aim to understand and articulate in your words, using LLMs as asupportive tool, not a primary crutch.4. Collaboration vs. Copying: While collaboration is encouraged for brainstorming and problem-solving, always ensure that what you submit is your team’s authentic work. Sharing code, data,or report content between teams is considered a breach of these guidelines.5. Ensure Private Repositories: You are strongly encouraged to make use of an online repos-itory to coordinate and store your team’s work, e.g., using Github or Gitlab. However, it iscrucial that you make your repository private (make sure you give access to your team’s TA).If your repository is public and another team uses your work, both your team (for sharing) andthe copying team (for using) can be held accountable for academic misconduct.Remember, the purpose of this project is to immerse yourself in the world of AI, develop skills, andgain a profound understanding of the challenges and responsibilities that come with the domain.Adhering to these academic integrity guidelines ensures a level playing field and a genuine learningexperience for all.
